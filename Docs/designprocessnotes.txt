Neck Movement on Pan/Tilt Servo
	many_attempts_later(pantilt3.models){
// Spent most of December trying different files for neck pan+rotate
}

Beak Grip Mantis-style on single MG90s servo

1.13.25 Model and Print Notes: 
	attempt_1(eye-cam-mount.models){	
	supports too thick, difficult to remove, too much overhang next to fragile legs; 
	slots for ArduCam too small, expand out slot 4mm wide, camera slot 1mm wide;
	too much excess material;
}

	attempt_2(eye-cam-mount2.models){
	Modeling in Progress;
